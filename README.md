# PWA-With-Expo

Simple project developed to experience pwa creation with expo,
and, use of the camera.
In this application I implemented a connection with the Github API to list
how many members are on Rocketseat's Github.
(Note: camera is not working for mobile, because, the focus of this project was to focus
in web development only).

```sh
$ cd pwa-expo
```

## How to install packages

$ yarn
```
